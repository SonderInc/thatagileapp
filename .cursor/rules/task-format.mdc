# Task format

When the user asks to add a task, create a task, or provides a task description, use the following format. When interpreting a task that uses this structure, follow the CURSOR INSTRUCTIONS section (OBJECTIVE, FILES TO CHANGE, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, CONSTRAINTS, ACCEPTANCE CHECK).

Fill OBJECTIVE, FILES TO CHANGE, IMPLEMENTATION STEPS, CONSTRAINTS, and ACCEPTANCE CHECK per task. The CONSTRAINTS and ACCEPTANCE CHECK bullets below are examples and can be adjusted for the task.

## Template
