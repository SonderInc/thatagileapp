Firestore rules are in firestore.rules and are deployed via CLI:

  npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

Storage rules (required for company logo uploads) are in storage.rules. Deploy them with:

  npx firebase deploy --only storage

To deploy both in one go:

  npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage

Do not paste into Realtime Database (that uses JSON). Use the commands above.

If you must use the Console:
- Firestore: Build → Firestore Database → Rules tab, paste firestore.rules (first line: rules_version = '2';).
- Storage: Build → Storage → Rules tab, paste storage.rules. Without these, logo upload will fail with "insufficient permissions".
