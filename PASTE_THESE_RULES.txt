Firestore rules are in firestore.rules and are deployed via CLI.

  npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

Do not paste into Realtime Database (that uses JSON). Use the command above.

If you must use the Console: Build → Firestore Database → Rules tab, then paste the contents of firestore.rules. The first line must be rules_version = '2'; (single quotes).
